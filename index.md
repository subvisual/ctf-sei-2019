# SEI 19 - Capture the Flag

The rules are simple:

1. You start at the first challenge's page (linked below);
2. From there, you need to find the hint that takes you to the second challenge;
3. Repeat... until you reach the last one!

<div class="centered">
<a href='{{ "/challenges/first" | relative_url }}'>{{ site.data.text.start_here }}</a>
</div>
<br>
<br>

Or read the [FAQ]({{ "/faq" | relative_url }}) if you have questions...
